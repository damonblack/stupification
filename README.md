# stupidification

Stupidist thing that could possibly work.

Sandbox project to learn and have fun. Maybe even make something cool. 

Starting off with Rails on the backend, react.js for webpage stuff, and phaser.io for some kind of game to play. 

This is a dumb combination of tech, all the cool kids are running Node on the server. But I think it might be a valuable learning tool, especially in regard to incrementally introducing React in a standard Rails app. I suspect we'll run into clients with a requirement for just such a hare-brained stunt.
