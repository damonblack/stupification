# stupidification

Stupidist thing that could possibly work.

Sandbox project to learn and have fun. Maybe even make something cool. 

Starting off with Rails on the backend, react.js for webpage stuff, and phaser.io for some kind of game to play. 

This is a dumb combination of tech, all the cool kids are running Node on the server. But I think it might be a valuable learning tool, especially in regard to incrementally introducing React in a standard Rails app. I suspect we'll run into clients with a requirement for just such a hare-brained stunt.

Also - The Rules of Improve apply:

1. Say “yes’and!”
2. Add new information.
3. Don’t block.
4. Avoid asking questions- unless you’re also adding information.
5. Play in the present and use the moment.
6. Establish the location.
7. Be specific and provide colorful details.
8. Change, Change, Change!
9. For serious and emotional scenes, focus on characters and relationships.
10. For humorous scenes, take choices to the nth degree or focus on actions/objects.
